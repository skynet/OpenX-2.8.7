$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_dbname'] = "\n        Specify the name of the database where ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." must store its data.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_persistent_connections'] = "\n        The use of persistent connection can speed up ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." considerably \n		and may even decrease the load on the server. There is a drawback however, on sites with \n		a lot of visitors the load on the server can increase and become larger then when using normal \n		connections. Whether you should use regular connections or persistant connections depends on the \n		number of visitors and the hardware your are using. If ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." is using too many resources, \n		you should take a look at this setting first.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_compatibility_mode'] = "\n        If you are having problem integrating ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." with another thirth-party product it \n		might help to turn on the database compatibility mode. If you are using local mode \n		invocation and the database compatibility is turned on ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." should leave \n		the state of the database connection exectly the same as it was before ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." ran. \n		This option is a bit slower (only slightly) and therefore turned off by default.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_table_prefix'] = "\n        If the database ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." is using is shared by mutiple software products, it is wise\n		to add a prefix to names of the tables. If you are using multiple installations of ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME."\n		in the same database, you need to make sure this prefix is unique for all installations.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_tabletype'] = "\n        ".$phpAds_dbmsname." supports multiple table types. Each type of table has unique properties and some\n		can speed up ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." considerable. MyISAM is the default table type and is available\n		in all installations of ".$phpAds_dbmsname.". Other table types may not be available on your server\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_url_prefix'] = "\n        ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." needs to know where it is located on the web server in order \n        to work correctly. You must specify the URL to the directory where ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." \n        is installed, for example: http://www.your-url.com/".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME.".\n		";

You \n        can put either text or html in these files (if you want to use html in \n        one or both of these files do not use tags like <body> or <html>).\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_content_gzip_compression'] = "\n		By enabling GZIP content compression you will get a big decrease of the data which \n		is sent to the browser each time a page of the administrator interface is opened. \n		To enable this feature you need to have at least PHP 4.0.5 with the GZIP extention installed.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_language'] = "\n        Specify the default language ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." should use. This language will \n        be used as a default for the admin and advertiser interface. Please note: \n        you can set a different language for each advertiser from the admin interface \n        and allow advertisers to change their language themselves.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_name'] = "\n        Specify the name you want to use for this application. This string will \n        be displayed on all pages in the admin and advertiser interface.

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_override_gd_imageformat'] = "\n        ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." usually detects if the GD library is installed and which image \n        format is supported by the installed version of GD. However it is possible \n        the detection is not accurate or false, some versions of PHP do not allow \n        the detection of the supported image formats. If ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." fails to auto-detect \n        the right image format you can specify the right image format. Possible \n        values are: none, png, jpeg, gif.\n		";

The default setting \n        is: 'CUR ADM OUR NOR STA NID', which will allow Internet Explorer 6 to \n        accept the cookies used by ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME.".

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_compact_stats'] = "\n        Traditionally ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." used rather extensive logging, which was very \n        detailed but was also very demanding on the database server. This could \n        be a big problem on sites with a lot of visitors. To overcome this problem\n		".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." also supports a new kind of statistics, the compact statistics, \n		which is less demanding on the database server, but also less detailed. \n		The compact statistics only logs daily statistics, if you need hourly statistics \n		you can turn the compact statistics off.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_log_adviews'] = "\n        Normally all AdViews are logged, if you don't want to gather statistics \n        about AdViews you can turn this off.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_block_adviews'] = "\n		If a visitor reloads a page an AdView will be logged by ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." every time. \n		This feature is used to make sure that only one AdView is logged for each unique \n		banner for the number of seconds you specify. For example: if you set this value \n		to 300 seconds, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will only log AdViews if the same banner isnÄ?Å¼Ë?t already \n		shown to the same visitor in the last 5 minutes. This feature only works when <i>Use \n		beacons to log AdViews</i> is enabled and if the browser accepts cookies.\n		";

For example: if you set this value \n		to 300 seconds, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will only log AdClicks if the visitor didnÄ?Å¼Ë?t click on the same \n		banner in the last 5 minutes. This feature only works when the browser accepts cookies.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_reverse_lookup'] = "\n        ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." logs the IP address of each visitor by default. If you want \n        ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." to log domain names you should turn this on. Reverse lookup \n        does take some time; it will slow everything down.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_proxy_lookup'] = "\n		Some users are using a proxy server to access the internet. In that case \n		".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will log the IP address or the hostname of the proxy server \n		instead of the user. If you enable this feature ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will try to \n		find the ip address or hostname of the user behind the proxy server. \n		If it is not possible to find the exact address of the user it will use \n		the address of the proxy server instead. This option is not enable by default, \n		because it will slow logging down.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_ignore_hosts'] = "\n        If you don't want to count clicks and views from certain computer you \n        can add these to this array. If you have enabled reverse lookup you can \n        add both domain names and IP addresses, otherwise you can only use IP \n        addresses. You can also use wildcards (i.e. '*.altavista.com' or '192.168.*').\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_begin_of_week'] = "\n        For most people a week starts on a Monday, but if you want to start each \n        week on a Sunday you can.\n		";

This setting lets you decide when \n        a cached zone will be reloaded, by specifing the maximum lifetime of the \n        cached zone. For example: if you set this setting to 600, the cache will \n        be rebuild if the cached zone is older than 10 minutes (600 seconds).\n		";
