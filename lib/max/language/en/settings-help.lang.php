        Specify the number of the port of the ".$phpAds_dbmsname." database server to which you are trying to
		connect. The default port number for a ".$phpAds_dbmsname." database is <i>" . ($phpAds_dbmsname == 'MySQL' ? '3306' : '5432')."</i>.
		";

		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_dbname'] = "
        Specify the name of the database on the database server where ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." must store its data.
		Important the database must already be created on the database server. ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will <b>not</b> create
		this database if it does not exist yet.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_persistent_connections'] = "
        The use of persistent connection can speed up ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." considerably
		and may even decrease the load on the server. There is a drawback however, on sites with
		a lot of visitors the load on the server can increase and become larger then when using normal
		connections. Whether you should use regular connections or persistant connections depends on the
		number of visitors and the hardware your are using. If ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." is using too many resources,
		you should take a look at this setting first.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_compatibility_mode'] = "
        If you are having problem integrating ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." with another thirth-party product it
		might help to turn on the database compatibility mode. If you are using local mode
		invocation and the database compatibility is turned on ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." should leave
		the state of the database connection exectly the same as it was before ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." ran.
		This option is a bit slower (only slightly) and therefore turned off by default.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_table_prefix'] = "
        If the database ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." is using is shared by multiple software products, it is wise
		to add a prefix to names of the tables. If you are using multiple installations of ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME."
		in the same database, you need to make sure this prefix is unique for all installations.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_table_type'] = "
        ".phpAds_dbmsname." supports multiple table types. Each type of table has unique properties and some
		can speed up ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." considerable. MyISAM is the default table type and is available
		in all installations of ".phpAds_dbmsname.". Other table types may not be available on your server.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_url_prefix'] = "
        ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." needs to know where it is located on the web server in order

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_my_logo'] = "
        You should put here the name of the custom logo file that you wish to display instead
        of the default logo.  The logo must be placed in the admin/images directory before
        setting the file name here.
               ";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_gui_header_foreground_color'] = "
        You should put here a custom color which will be used for tabs, the search bar, and

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_content_gzip_compression'] = "
		By enabling GZIP content compression you will get a big decrease of the data which

		To enable this feature you need to have the GZIP extention installed.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_language'] = "
        Specify the default language ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." should use. This language will
        be used as a default for the admin and advertiser interface. Please note:
        you can set a different language for each advertiser from the admin interface
        and allow advertisers to change their language themselves.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_name'] = "
        Specify the name you want to use for this application. This string will

        format is supported by the installed version of GD. However it is possible
        the detection is not accurate or false, some versions of PHP do not allow
        the detection of the supported image formats. If ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." fails to auto-detect
        the right image format you can specify the right image format. Possible
        values are: none, png, jpeg, gif.

		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_compact_stats'] = "
        Traditionally ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." used rather extensive logging, which was very
        detailed but was also very demanding on the database server. This could
        be a big problem on sites with a lot of visitors. To overcome this problem
		".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." also supports a new kind of statistics, the compact statistics,
		which is less demanding on the database server, but also less detailed.
		The compact statistics collects AdViews, AdClicks, and AdConversions for each hour, if you need
		more detail you can turn the compact statistics off.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_log_adviews'] = "
        Normally all AdViews are logged, if you don't want to gather statistics
        about AdViews you can turn this off.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_block_adviews'] = "
		If a visitor reloads a page an AdView will be logged by ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." every time.
		This feature is used to make sure that only one AdView is logged for each unique
		banner for the number of seconds you specify. For example: if you set this value
		to 300 seconds, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will only log AdViews if the same banner isn�t already

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_block_adclicks'] = "
		If a visitor clicks multiple times on a banner an AdClick will be logged by ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME."
		every time. This feature is used to make sure that only one AdClick is logged for each
		unique banner for the number of seconds you specify. For example: if you set this value
		to 300 seconds, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will only log AdClicks if the visitor didn�t click on the same
		banner in the last 5 minutes. This feature only works when the browser accepts cookies.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_log_adconversions'] = "
        Normally all AdConversions are logged, if you don't want to gather statistics
        about AdConversions you can turn this off.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_block_adconversions'] = "
		If a visitor reloads a page with an AdConversion beacon, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will log the AdConversion
		every time. This feature is used to make sure that only one AdConversion is logged for each
		unique conversion for the number of seconds you specify. For example: if you set this value
		to 300 seconds, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will only log AdConversions if the visitor didn�t load the same
		page with the AdConversion beacon in the last 5 minutes. This feature only works when the browser accepts cookies.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_geotracking_stats'] = "
		If you are using a geotargeting database you can also store the geographical information
		in the database. If you have enabled this option you will be able to see statistics about the
		location of your visitors and how each banner is performing in the different countries.
		This option will only be available to you if you are using verbose statistics.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_reverse_lookup'] = "
		The hostname is usually determined by the web server, but in some cases this might be
		turned off. If you want to use the visitors hostname inside delivery limitations and/or
		keep statistics about this and the server doesn't provide this information you will need to
		turn this option on. Determining the hostname of the visitor does take some time; it will
		slow the delivery of banners down.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_proxy_lookup'] = "
		Some visitors are using a proxy server to access the internet. In that case ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will
		log the IP address or the hostname of the proxy server instead of the user. If you enable
		this feature ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will try to find the IP address or hostname of the visitor's computer
		behind the proxy server. If it is not possible to find the exact address of the visitor
		it will use the address of the proxy server instead. This option is not enabled by default,
		because it will slow the delivery of banners down considerably.

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_geotracking_type'] = "
		Geotargeting allows ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." to convert the IP address of the visitor to geographical
		information. Based on this information you can set delivery limitations or you could store
		this information to see which country is generation the most impressions or click-thrus.
		If you want to enable geotargeting you need to choose which type of database you have.
		".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." currently supports the <a href='http://hop.clickbank.net/?phpadsnew/ip2country' target='_blank'>IP2Country</a>
		and <a href='http://www.maxmind.com/?rId=phpadsnew' target='_blank'>GeoIP</a> database.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_geotracking_location'] = "
		Unless you are the GeoIP Apache module, you should tell ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." the location of the
		geotargeting database. It is always recommended to place the database outside of the web
		servers document root, because otherwise people are able to download the database.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_geotracking_cookie'] = "
		Converting the IP address in geographical information takes time. To prevent
		".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." from having to do this every time a banner is delivered the result can be
		stored in a cookie. If this cookie is present ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will use this information instead
		of converting the IP address.
		";

        If you don't want to count views, clicks, and conversions from certain computer you
        can add these to this list. If you have enabled reverse lookup you can
        add both domain names and IP addresses, otherwise you can only use IP

		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_warn_client'] = "
        ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." can sent the advertiser email if one of his campaigns has only a
		limited number of views, clicks, or conversions left. This is turned on by default.
		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_qmail_patch'] = "
		Some versions of qmail are affected by a bug, which causes email sent by

        If ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." can't connect to the database server, or can't find any matching
        banners at all, for example when the database crashed or was deleted,
        it won't display anything. Some users may want to specify a default banner,
        which will be displayed in these situations. The default banner specified
        here will not be logged and won't be used if there are still active banners
        left in the database. This is turned off by default.

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_delivery_caching'] = "
		To help speed up the delivery ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." uses a cache which includes all
		the information needed to delivery the banner to the visitor of your website. The delivery
		cache is stored by default in the database, but to increase the speed even more it is also
		possible to store the cache inside a file or inside shared memory. Shared memory is fastest,
