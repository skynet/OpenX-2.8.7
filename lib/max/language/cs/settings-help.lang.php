$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_persistent_connections'] = "\n        The use of persistent connection can speed up ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." considerably\n		and may even decrease the load on the server. There is a drawback however, on sites with\n		a lot of visitors the load on the server can increase and become larger then when using normal\n		connections. Whether you should use regular connections or persistant connections depends on the\n		number of visitors and the hardware your are using. If ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." is using too many resources,\n		you should take a look at this setting first.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_table_prefix'] = "\n        If the database ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." is using is shared by multiple software products, it is wise\n		to add a prefix to names of the tables. If you are using multiple installations of ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME."\n		in the same database, you need to make sure this prefix is unique for all installations.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_table_type'] = "\n        ".$phpAds_dbmsname." supports multiple table types. Each type of table has unique properties and some\n		can speed up ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." considerable.

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_content_gzip_compression'] = "\n		By enabling GZIP content compression you will get a big decrease of the data which\n		is sent to the browser each time a page of the administrator interface is opened.\n		To enable this feature you need to have at least PHP 4.0.5 with the GZIP extention installed.\n		";

However it is possible\n        the detection is not accurate or false, some versions of PHP do not allow\n        the detection of the supported image formats. If ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." fails to auto-detect\n        the right image format you can specify the right image format. Possible\n        values are: none, png, jpeg, gif.\n		";

To overcome this problem\n		".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." also supports a new kind of statistics, the compact statistics,\n		which is less demanding on the database server, but also less detailed.\n		The compact statistics collects AdViews, AdClicks, and AdConversions for each hour, if you need\n		more detail you can turn the compact statistics off.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_log_adviews'] = "\n        Normally all AdViews are logged, if you don't want to gather statistics\n        about AdViews you can turn this off.\n		";

For example: if you set this value\n		to 300 seconds, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will only log AdViews if the same banner isnÄ?Å¼Ë?t already\n		shown to the same visitor in the last 5 minutes.

This feature is used to make sure that only one AdClick is logged for each\n		unique banner for the number of seconds you specify. For example: if you set this value\n		to 300 seconds, ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will only log AdClicks if the visitor didnÄ?Å¼Ë?t click on the same\n		banner in the last 5 minutes.

If you have enabled this option you will be able to see statistics about the\n		location of your visitors and how each banner is performing in the different countries.\n		This option will only be available to you if you are using verbose statistics.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_log_hostname'] = "\n		If you want to store the hostname or IP address of each visitor in the statistics you can\n		enable this feature. Storing this information will allow you to see which hosts are retrieving\n		the most banners. This option is only available if you are using verbose statistics.\n		";

$GLOBALS['phpAds_hlp_log_iponly'] = "\n		Storing the hostname of the visitor takes a lot of space inside the database. If you enable\n		this feature ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will still store information about the host, but it will store the\n		less space consuming IP address only. This option isnÄ?Å¼Ë?t available if the hostname isn't\n		provided by the server or ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME.", because in that case the IP address will always be\n		stored.\n		";

If you want to use the visitors hostname inside delivery limitations and/or\n		keep statistics about this and the server doesn't provide this information you will need to\n		turn this option on.

In that case ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will\n		log the IP address or the hostname of the proxy server instead of the user. If you enable\n		this feature ".MAX_PRODUCT_NAME." will try to find the IP address or hostname of the visitor's computer\n		behind the proxy server. If it is not possible to find the exact address of the visitor\n		it will use the address of the proxy server instead.
