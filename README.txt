    OpenX - The ad server for publishers who are serious about making money
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

    OpenX is an open source ad serving tool that enables publishers to:

      * Serve ads on their websites;

      * Manage their campaigns from different advertisers and/or ad networks
          using the simple, easy-to-use interface;

      * Track and report on campaign success, including click-through
          rates;

      * Set rules to target the delivery of campaigns, or even ads, to
          specific users, to help maximise the effectiveness of campaigns.

    OpenX was formerly known as Openads and phpAdsNew.
