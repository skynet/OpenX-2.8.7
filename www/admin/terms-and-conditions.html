      <strong>Schedule 1</strong> GNU General Public Licence
      Version 2
    </div>

    <p align="justify">This License applies to any program or
    other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright
    holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
    General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
    such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
    either the Program or any derivative work under copyright
    law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
    portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
    translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
    is included without limitation in the term "modification".)
    Each licensee is addressed as "you".</p>

    <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and
    modification are not covered by this License; they are
    outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not
    restricted, and the output from the Program</p>

    <p>is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
    the Program (independent of having been made by running the
    Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program
    does.</p>

    <p>1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the
    Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium,
    provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
    each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of
    warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
    License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any
    other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</p>

    <p>along with the Program.</p>

    <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring
    a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection
    in exchange for a fee.</p>

    <p>2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or
    any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program,
    and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
    terms of Section 1</p>

    <p>above, provided that you also meet all of these
    conditions:</p>

    <p>a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent
    notices stating that you changed the files and the date of
    any change.</p>

    <p>b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish,
    that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the
    Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
    charge to all third</p>

    <p>parties under the terms of this License.</p>

    <p>c) If the modified program normally reads commands
    interactively when run, you must cause it, when started
    running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to
    print or display an announcement including an appropriate
    copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may
    redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling
    the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if
    the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
    such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not
    required to print an announcement.)</p>

    <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
    If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from
    the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and
    separate works in themselves, then this License, and its
    terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute
    them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
    sections as part of a whole which is a work based</p>

    <p>on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
    the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
    licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and
    every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>

    <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights
    or contest your rights to work written entirely by you;
    rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
    distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
    Program.</p>

    <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on
    the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the
    Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does
    not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>

    <p>3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work
    based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
    form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that
    you also do one of the following:</p>

    <p>a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
    the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
    used for software</p>

    <p>interchange; or,</p>

    <p>b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least
    three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more
    than your cost of physically performing source distribution,
    a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source
    code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2
    above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;
    or,</p>

    <p>c) Accompany it with the information you received as to
    the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
    alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution
    and only if you received the program in object code or
    executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection
    b above.)</p>

    <p>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the
    work for making modifications to it. For an executable work,
    complete source code means all the source code for all
    modules it contains, plus any</p>

    <p>associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
    used to control compilation and installation of the
    executable. However, as a special exception, the source code
    distributed need not include anything that is normally
    distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
    components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating
    system on which the executable runs, unless that component
    itself accompanies the executable.</p>

    <p>If distribution of executable or object code is made by
    offering access to copy from a designated place, then
    offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the
    same place counts as distribution of the source code, even
    though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
    along with the object code.</p>

    <p>4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the
    Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any
    attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute
    the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your
    rights under this License. However, parties who have received
    copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have
    their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
    full compliance.</p>

    <p>5. You are not required to accept this License, since you
    have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
    permission to modify or distribute the Program or its
    derivative works. These actions are</p>

    <p>prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
    Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any
    work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
    this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
    copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based
    on it.</p>

    <p>6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work
    based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a
    license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or
    modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You
    may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
    exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
    responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this
    License.</p>

    <p>7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation
    of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited
    to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
    court order, agreement or</p>

    <p>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License,
    they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.
    If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your
    obligations under this</p>

    <p>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
    consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For
    example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free
    redistribution of the Program by</p>

    <p>all those who receive copies directly or indirectly
    through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and
    this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution
    of the Program.</p>

    <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or
    unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance
    of the section is intended to apply and the section as a
    whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>

    <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to
    infringe any patents or other property right claims or to
    contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
    sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
    distribution system, which is implemented by public license
    practices. Many people have made generous contributions to
    the wide range of software distributed through that system in
    reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
    to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</p>

    <p>to distribute software through any other system and a
    licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>

    <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is
    believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

    <p>8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is
    restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
    copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who
    places the Program under this License may add an explicit
    geographical distribution limitation excluding those
    countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License
    incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
    License.</p>

    <p>9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
    new versions of the General Public License from time to time.
    Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present
    version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or
    concerns.</p>

    <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If
    the Program specifies a version number of this License which
    applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
    following the terms and conditions either of that version or
    of any later version published by the Free Software
    Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number
    of this License, you may choose any version ever published by
    the Free Software Foundation.</p>

    <p>10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into
    other free programs whose distribution conditions are
    different, write to the author to ask for permission. For
    software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
    Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
    sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
    guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all
    derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
    and reuse of software generally.</p>

    <p>NO WARRANTY</p>

    <p>11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE
    IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

    <p>EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
    HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS"
    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
    MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
    ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
    IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
    THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
    CORRECTION.</p>

    <p>12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR
    AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
    PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS
    PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
    GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
    OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
    NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE
    OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
    THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH
    HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
    SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
